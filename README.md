# hello-world
Y qu√© es esto?
I going to write a little about myself... 
Well, my english is shit, no no... it's SHIT. But i'm making good progress in that way, i`m pretty sure.
So, my life is absolutely awesome, yesterday i spent all the afternoon aspiring powdered juice. These drag me into
a powerfull state of inspiration and reflexive sense. A really complex tangle of cosmological truths was revealed to me,
and this made me change my whole perception of human existence
That crap allowed me arrive to one obvius conclusion: we are we. So simple, SO BEAUTIFUL. 
That push me into a depresive and deep hole, the only way to rise and be free is learn how elevate my pineal gland 
at the 5th cosmological-tantra-meridian... in order to succes, i registered in GitHub because i heard that here exist a 
completly guide to how do the pineal thing affair. If someone know some info about, please, text me.
